Added R^2 value to the linear regression model
As this model is not a predictive model, but is more of an introspective model, plots didn't seem to offer any extra

To view the final draft of this project, see Final_v5. There are a few redundancies in the code, but I decided to keep them,
as I do not wish to change any of the syntax or naming conventions after I finally got the code to run.
